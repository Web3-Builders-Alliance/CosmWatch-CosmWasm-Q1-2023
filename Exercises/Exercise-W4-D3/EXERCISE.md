# Cluster 2-3ish challenge

Create a contract that instantiates a cw20 token

âœ… Mints an amount of cw20 token equal to the amount of native tokens that are sent to the contract.

For example, if you send 100 uluna to the contract, the contract should mint you 100 tokens of the cw20 token you create.

âœ… The contract should be migratable, and you should deploy this on testnet and run a migration on it.

- You should write tests (unit or integration) validating the actions on the first point. 

- Optional: it should be possible to withdraw your original tokens by sending the LP tokens back to the contract.

Have fun! ðŸ˜ˆ
